# Automatic Drilling Robo

## Description

We have created a working robo car for automatic drilling work through a simple click on a user mobile. Automatic drilling robo is a prototype for a future model of drilling in mining section where many worker loss their life due to harmful gases or other cause during drilling activities in deep mining .Our project reduce the load and increase the efficiency of work in mining section. 
we have made the project which is the combination of Robocar and drilling machine which is fully automatic and control using your phone .
we have design a car on which drill bit mechanism is mount and used the servo motor for the rotation of drill . All these mechanisms is control through the blink app on just simple click from your phone .

### Future Scope 

we can modify by using esp cam which will provide the live visual during drilling process and provide proper view during drilling to user on it mobile .

1. Esp8266 Node mcu
2. 775 dc motor 
3. Drill bit 
4. L298N 2A Dual motor driver 
5. Connecting wires
6. Lithium ion battery
